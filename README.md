# Decision-Tree-Classification-on-Heart-Disease

Heart disease prevention is better thaan cure.

I modeled the difference heart disease using decision tree with types of chest pain as the independent variable.

I used R Statistical software for this analysis with libraries such as:
party
rpart
dplyr
readr
metrics

I used 303 rows and 15 columns mixed with categorical variables.

I attcahed powerpoint presentation to help you understand the analysis.

Thank you for stopping by.
